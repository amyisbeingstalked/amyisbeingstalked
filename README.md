- 👋 Hi, I’m @amyisbeingstalked
- 👀 I’m interested in getting all the help I can with my Verizon TCL phone as I have a stalker who is going to kill me and has taken over every aspect of my phone.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to reach out for help as I know nothing about any of this.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on getting my phone and life back!
- 📫 How to reach me this stalker controls my phone but you can try amy.strong28@yahoo.com or amyjeanstrong@gmail.com. I have no clue about this kind of thing, all I know is he controls when n what calls n texts I receive and he's probably seeing this now bc he sees everything from my phone. When I do a factory reset it does nothing. The texts n call logs n all are still there. Verizon is no help, I'm reaching out to you as my last option, I'm begging someone to pls help me before it's too late.
